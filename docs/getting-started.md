# Getting Started

## What is Dev-Rebase?

Dev-Rebase is a collection of short guides designed to help developers learn about modern software development practices. These guides cover essential topics that are commonly expected in today's tech industry, especially when working at international companies or applying for remote positions.

## Why I created this website?

### My personal journey

I'm [Mohammad Ghanem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghanem-mhd/), a software engineer who moved from Syria to Germany. As someone from Syria, I experienced firsthand how software development practices can vary significantly between different regions and markets...

This became very clear when I moved to Germany and started working at different companies. I quickly realized there were many practices and approaches that most companies expected me to know as a developer. I had to actively learn these topics to bridge the gap in my knowledge and meet industry standards.

### Coaching experience that inspired this project

About a year ago, I started volunteering with the [Imagine Foundation](https://www.joinimagine.com/) as a technical coach. I began conducting technical coaching sessions for developers who were trying to enter the European job market. Over the course of this work, I completed dozens of sessions, numbering in the high double digits, with people at different skill levels.

I loved every single session and had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful people. During these sessions, I noticed that most fellows (we call them fellows because that's the name of the program at Imagine) faced similar knowledge gaps. This happened for the same reasons I experienced - their work environments implemented fewer modern practices, and the expectations were lower.

This gap in knowledge and skills could affect their chances when applying for remote jobs or positions that require relocation. After seeing this pattern repeat many times, I realized it would be valuable to collect these practices and topics in one place and share them with my fellows and anyone else who might find them useful.

## For who?

This guide is **not** a roadmap to learn programming or start in the tech world. Instead, it targets:

- Developers who already know how to program.
- Computer Science graduates with programming knowledge.
- People already working in the industry as frontend, backend, or mobile engineers.
- Anyone looking to understand modern development practices used in international companies.

If you can already program and build applications, but want to learn about industry practices, tools, and methodologies, this guide is for you.

## How to use this guide?

The topics are presented in an order that makes logical sense, but **you can read them in any order** that works for you. Each guide is designed to be self-contained, so feel free to jump to topics that interest you most or that you need to learn for your current work. At the end of each topic, there a list of resources in English and Arabic. These resources are not exhaustive and don't the topic in depth, but they are a good starting point to learn more.
